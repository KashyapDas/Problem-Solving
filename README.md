# 🧠 Problem Solving

This repository is a collection of **problem-solving exercises**, **Python programs**, and **concept-based examples** aimed at improving coding logic, algorithmic thinking, and understanding of Python fundamentals.  
It also includes hands-on examples covering **Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs)**, **Python Standard Library modules**, and **functional programming features** like **lambda functions**.
